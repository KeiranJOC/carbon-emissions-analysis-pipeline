# carbon-emissions-analysis-pipeline
A data engineering pipeline to facilitate analysis of carbon emissions at UK Ministry of Justice buildings.

An analyst at my company needs to provide an analysis of the carbon emissions of UK Ministry of Justice buildings. I've been asked to provide the data needed for the analysis. This can be supported by two data sources:
1. energy consumption data published by the UK government - http://www.ecodriver.uk.com/eCMS/Viewfiles.asp?folder=MOJ
2. emissions conversion factor data published by the UK government - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2021
